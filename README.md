# Gulp-Boilerplate

This boilerplate was created to quickly setup an environment that included a live server, sass, html/js/css minifiers, and an autoprefixer. It uses Gulp.js as the task runner.

Before using this, you will need to run 

```
npm init
```

This will install the necessary modules.

Once you have installed all of the node modules, type gulp in the terminal to start.

```
gulp
```
