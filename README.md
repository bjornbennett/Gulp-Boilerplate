# Gulp-Boilerplate

This boilerplate was created to quickly setup an environment that included a live server, sass, html/js/css minifiers, and an autoprefixer. It uses Gulp.js as the task runner.

Once cloned, run `npm install` to install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once you have installed all of the node modules, type gulp in the terminal to start.

```
gulp
```
